5> What is ReactDOM used for? Write an example?
ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM-specific methods for React. It is used for rendering React components into the DOM. Here's an example:

<!-- import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const Greeting = () => {
  return <p>Welcome to the React world!</p>;
}; -->


6> What are the packages that you need to import for React to work with?
To work with React, you typically need to import two main packages: react and react-dom. Additionally, if you are using JSX, you might need Babel to transpile your code.

<!-- jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; -->
7> How do you add React to a web application?
To add React to a web application, you need to include the React library and ReactDOM in your project. You can include them using script tags in an HTML file or by using a package manager like npm or yarn.

8> What is React.createElement?
React.createElement is a method used to create React elements. It takes three arguments: the type of the element (e.g., a string for HTML elements or a React component), the element's properties (or null if none), and the element's children.


9> What are the three properties that createElement accepts?
The three properties that React.createElement accepts are:

Type: The type of the React element, such as a string for HTML elements or a React component.
Props: The properties or attributes of the React element.
Children: The content or child elements of the React element.


10> What is the meaning of render and root in ReactDOM?
render: In ReactDOM, render is a method used to render a React element or component into the DOM. It takes two arguments: the React element to be rendered and the DOM element where the rendering should occur.

root: The "root" typically refers to the DOM element where your React application is mounted. It is the container element in which your React components are rendered. In the example above, document.getElementById('root') is the root element.
